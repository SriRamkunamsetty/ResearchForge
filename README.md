## Overview

ResearchForge is an open-source platform being built for researchers, students, and academic teams who are overwhelmed by the volume and fragmentation of scientific literature.

The goal is to combine **semantic search**, **knowledge graphs**, and **AI-assisted workflows** into a single, unified research operating system — helping researchers discover connections across papers, organize their thinking, and collaborate with their team.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose
- WSL2 (Windows users) — see [docs/WindowsSetup.md](docs/WindowsSetup.md) for step-by-step instructions
- Git

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanmejaiPratapTonk-123/ResearchForge.git
cd ResearchForge
```

### Run Project

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Available Scaffold Services

- Frontend shell → [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend health endpoint → [http://localhost:4000/health](http://localhost:4000/health)
- AI-service health endpoint → [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)
- PostgreSQL container → `localhost:5432`

These are the services and endpoints implemented by the current scaffold. Search, knowledge graphs, authentication, citation management, collaboration, and other product APIs remain future milestone work.

### Stop Project

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Current Project Status

> 🔵 **ResearchForge is in active development under IEEE Summer of Code 2026.** The M1.5 project scaffold is available locally through Docker Compose. It provides a frontend shell, backend and AI-service health endpoints, database configuration, documentation, and development automation. Core business logic, product APIs, and feature-specific service layers are intentionally not implemented yet and are reserved for future milestones.

| Area                         | Status         | Active Milestone |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Repository & Community Setup | ✅ Complete    | M0               |
| Tech Stack & Architecture    | ✅ Finalized   | M1               |
| Project Scaffolding          | ✅ Runnable baseline | M1.5             |
| Core Implementation          | 🔴 Not Started | M2               |
| Alpha Release                | 🔴 Not Started | M3               |

## 👋 New Contributor? Start Here

Welcome to IEEE Summer of Code 2026! We welcome contributors of all skill levels — whether you specialize in design, documentation, frontend, backend, or AI/ML.

### ⏱️ 3-Step Onboarding (15 Minutes)

1. **Read the Onboarding Guide:** Start with [docs/GettingStarted.md](docs/GettingStarted.md) — a step-by-step walkthrough for your first contribution.
2. **Review the Contribution Rules:** Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch naming, commit formats, and the PR checklist.
3. **Pick an Issue:** Browse [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JanmejaiPratapTonk-123/ResearchForge/issues) and look for the `good first issue` label.

### Development Environment

Contributors only need Docker Desktop to run the scaffold locally, and Windows users should enable WSL2 as well. You do not need to manually install Node.js, PostgreSQL, or Python to work with the runnable scaffold.

Docker Compose provides the same development environment across Windows, macOS, and Linux. The updated `.dockerignore` files also avoid the Windows pnpm and `node_modules` symlink issues that can break local setup outside containers.

## Why ResearchForge?

Researchers today juggle:

- Multiple disconnected tools (Zotero, Notion, Google Scholar, ChatGPT)
- Manual literature review processes that don't scale
- No structured way to track relationships between concepts across papers
- Collaboration friction in academic teams

ResearchForge provides an integrated, open platform — built in the open, by researchers and developers together.
